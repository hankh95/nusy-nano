# Plato (428-348 BCE)

Plato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Along with his teacher [[people/socrates]] and his student [[people/aristotle]], Plato is considered one of the founders of Western philosophy and science.

## Life

Born into one of Athens' most distinguished families, Plato was expected to pursue a political career. The execution of Socrates in 399 BCE profoundly affected him, turning him away from politics toward philosophy.

After Socrates' death, Plato traveled extensively—to Italy, Sicily, and possibly Egypt. Around 387 BCE, he founded the Academy, which continued for nearly 900 years until closed by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE.

## The Theory of Forms

Plato's central philosophical contribution is the [[concepts/theory-of-forms]]. He argued that the physical world we perceive is merely a shadow of a higher reality consisting of perfect, eternal, unchanging Forms (or Ideas).

For example:
- Individual beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty
- Just acts reflect the Form of Justice
- Mathematical objects like circles approximate the perfect Form of Circle

The Forms exist in a realm accessible only through reason, not the senses. True knowledge (episteme) is knowledge of the Forms; mere opinion (doxa) concerns the changing physical world.

## The Allegory of the Cave

In [[works/republic]], Plato presents his famous [[concepts/allegory-of-cave]]. Prisoners chained in a cave see only shadows on a wall and mistake them for reality. If freed and dragged into sunlight, a prisoner would first be blinded, then gradually perceive the true nature of things, and finally understand the sun (representing the Form of the Good) as the source of all truth and being.

This allegory illustrates:
- The difference between appearance and reality
- The philosopher's journey from ignorance to knowledge
- The duty of the enlightened to return and educate others
- The resistance people show to having their beliefs challenged

## Political Philosophy

Plato's [[works/republic]] outlines his vision of the ideal state, ruled by philosopher-kings who have knowledge of the Good. Society should be divided into three classes mirroring the three parts of the soul:

| Soul Part | Class | Virtue |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Reason | Rulers (philosophers) | Wisdom |
| Spirit | Auxiliaries (warriors) | Courage |
| Appetite | Producers (workers) | Temperance |

Justice consists in each part performing its proper function without interfering with the others.

## Epistemology

In the dialogue Meno, Plato argues that learning is actually recollection (anamnesis). The soul, being immortal, has knowledge of the Forms from before birth. Education draws out this latent knowledge rather than implanting new information.

Plato distinguished:
- **Episteme**: True knowledge (of Forms)
- **Doxa**: Opinion (of particulars)
- **Eikasia**: Imagination (of images)

## Love and Beauty

The [[works/symposium]] presents Plato's theory of love (eros). Through a series of speeches, the dialogue ascends from physical attraction to love of beauty itself:

1. Love of a beautiful body
2. Love of all beautiful bodies
3. Love of beautiful souls
4. Love of beautiful customs and laws
5. Love of beautiful knowledge
6. Love of Beauty itself (the Form)

This "ladder of love" became influential in later mystical traditions.

## Legacy

Plato's influence on Western thought is incalculable. Alfred North Whitehead famously said that all of Western philosophy consists of "footnotes to Plato." His dialogues remain central to philosophical education, and concepts like Platonic love, the allegory of the cave, and the philosopher-king pervade Western culture.
