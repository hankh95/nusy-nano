# Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, and philologist whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. He is known for his critiques of traditional European morality and religion, as well as his radical questioning of truth and value.

## Life

Born into a Lutheran pastor's family, Nietzsche lost his father at age four. He proved a brilliant student, becoming professor of classical philology at the University of Basel at only twenty-four.

His health was always fragile, plagued by migraines, eye problems, and digestive ailments. After a decade of teaching, he resigned and spent the next ten years wandering Europe as an independent philosopher, living frugally in boarding houses.

His philosophical output during this period was remarkable: [[works/thus-spoke-zarathustra]], [[works/beyond-good-evil]], [[works/genealogy-morals]], and several other major works. Yet his books sold poorly, and he remained largely unknown.

In January 1889, Nietzsche collapsed in Turin, apparently after witnessing a horse being beaten. He spent his remaining eleven years in a state of mental incapacity, cared for by his mother and later his sister Elisabeth, who manipulated his legacy after his death.

## The Death of God

Nietzsche's proclamation of the [[concepts/death-of-god]] is perhaps his most famous idea. In The Gay Science, a madman declares: "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him."

This wasn't an atheist's triumphant announcement but a diagnosis of European culture. The Christian God—and with him, the metaphysical framework that gave meaning to Western civilization—had become unbelievable. Science, historical criticism, and modern life had eroded traditional faith.

The consequences were catastrophic: without God as the foundation of truth and morality, nihilism threatens. All values become questionable. Meaning must be created rather than discovered.

## Will to Power

The [[concepts/will-to-power]] is Nietzsche's central concept (though its meaning is disputed). Life itself, he argued, is will to power—not merely survival or pleasure, but expansion, growth, and creative self-overcoming.

Will to power is not primarily domination over others but self-mastery and the drive to create. Artists, philosophers, and free spirits exemplify will to power in its highest forms. Even the ascetic saint expresses will to power—through self-denial and spiritual ambition.

## Master and Slave Morality

In [[works/genealogy-morals]], Nietzsche traced the origins of moral concepts through historical and psychological analysis. He distinguished two types of morality:

| Master Morality | Slave Morality |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Good = noble, powerful, beautiful | Good = humble, meek, charitable |
| Bad = weak, contemptible | Evil = cruel, powerful |
| Self-affirming | Reactive, resentful |
| Life-affirming | Life-denying |

Slave morality arose when the weak, unable to assert themselves, revalued the masters' values. What the masters called good (strength, pride, power), the slaves called evil. What the masters despised (humility, meekness), the slaves called good.

Christianity, Nietzsche argued, represented the triumph of slave morality—a "transvaluation of values" that made weakness into virtue and strength into sin.

## The Übermensch

Nietzsche's [[concepts/ubermensch]] (often translated as "overman" or "superman") represents his ideal of human achievement. The Übermensch creates new values, affirms life fully, and transcends conventional morality.

In [[works/thus-spoke-zarathustra]], Nietzsche presents the Übermensch as humanity's goal: "Man is a rope, tied between beast and Übermensch—a rope over an abyss."

The Übermensch is not a biological superman but a spiritual one—someone who has overcome the human-all-too-human, who can say "yes" to life in all its suffering and create meaning in a godless world.

## Eternal Recurrence

The [[concepts/eternal-recurrence]] is Nietzsche's most existentially challenging thought experiment: What if you had to live your life infinitely many times, exactly as it has been, with every pain and joy recurring?

This thought serves as a test. Only someone who can embrace eternal recurrence—who can say "yes" to life without reservation—has truly affirmed existence. Most people, Nietzsche believed, would be crushed by this thought.

## Perspectivism

Nietzsche rejected the idea of a "God's eye view" of truth. All knowledge is perspectival, shaped by our particular standpoint, values, and needs. There are no facts, only interpretations.

This [[concepts/perspectivism]] doesn't collapse into relativism—some perspectives are richer, more comprehensive, more life-enhancing than others. But it rules out any final, absolute truth accessible to humans.

## Style

Nietzsche wrote brilliantly, using aphorisms, allegories, hyperbole, and irony. His style was deliberate: he wanted to provoke thought, not hand down doctrines. "I am not a man, I am dynamite," he wrote.

This literary quality makes him uniquely quotable but also easily misunderstood and misappropriated.

## Legacy

Nietzsche's influence pervades 20th and 21st-century thought. Existentialists like [[people/heidegger]] and Sartre drew on his confrontation with nihilism. Postmodernists like [[people/foucault]] and Derrida extended his critique of truth and power. His psychological insights anticipated Freud.

Unfortunately, his sister edited his unpublished writings to align with Nazi ideology, leading to his disgraceful association with that movement—a perversion he would have despised. Nietzsche was contemptuous of German nationalism and anti-Semitism.

Today, stripped of these distortions, Nietzsche remains one of philosophy's most challenging, exhilarating, and necessary voices.
