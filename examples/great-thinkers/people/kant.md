# Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)

Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher who is a central figure in modern philosophy. Kant argued that human concepts and categories structure our experience of the world, and that reason is the source of morality. His thought continues to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy.

## Life

Kant spent his entire life in and around Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), never traveling more than forty miles from the city. His daily routine was so regular that neighbors supposedly set their clocks by his afternoon walks.

Born to a harness-maker, Kant attended the University of Königsberg and later became a professor there. He taught logic, metaphysics, geography, and other subjects while publishing works on science, mathematics, and philosophy.

His reputation rests primarily on three "Critiques" written in his later years: the [[works/critique-pure-reason]] (1781), the [[works/critique-practical-reason]] (1788), and the Critique of Judgment (1790).

## The Copernican Revolution in Philosophy

Kant described his philosophical approach as a "Copernican revolution." Just as Copernicus explained planetary motion by hypothesizing that the Earth moves around the Sun, Kant explained human knowledge by hypothesizing that objects conform to our minds rather than our minds conforming to objects.

Before Kant, philosophers generally assumed that knowledge must correspond to objects as they are in themselves. Kant argued instead that we can only know objects as they appear to us, shaped by the inherent structures of our minds.

## Synthetic A Priori Knowledge

Kant's central epistemological question was: "How is synthetic a priori knowledge possible?"

- **Analytic** statements are true by definition ("Bachelors are unmarried")
- **Synthetic** statements add new information ("The cat is on the mat")
- **A priori** knowledge is independent of experience
- **A posteriori** knowledge depends on experience

Rationalists claimed substantial a priori knowledge; empiricists like [[people/hume]] denied it, arguing that all meaningful claims about the world require experience.

Kant argued that mathematics and fundamental principles of natural science are synthetic a priori—necessarily true but not mere tautologies. The question is how this is possible.

## Transcendental Idealism

Kant's answer was [[concepts/transcendental-idealism]]. The mind contributes certain forms to experience:

**Forms of Intuition:**
- Space and time are not properties of things-in-themselves but forms our minds impose on experience
- We necessarily experience everything in space and time because those are conditions for experience to be possible

**Categories of Understanding:**
- Concepts like causality, substance, and unity are not derived from experience but are conditions for having experience
- The understanding actively synthesizes sensory input using these categories

This explains how synthetic a priori knowledge is possible: we can know a priori that all events have causes because causality is a category we impose on experience, not something we discover in it.

## Phenomena and Noumena

Kant distinguished between:

| Phenomena | Noumena |
|-----------|---------|
| Things as they appear to us | Things as they are in themselves |
| Knowable | Unknowable |
| Structured by our minds | Independent of our minds |

We can have knowledge only of phenomena. The noumenal realm—things in themselves, God, the soul, free will—lies beyond the bounds of theoretical knowledge. Attempts to prove or disprove God's existence, for instance, inevitably fail because reason overreaches its proper domain.

## Ethics: The Categorical Imperative

In [[works/groundwork-metaphysics-morals]], Kant developed his ethical theory. Moral worth comes from acting from duty, not from inclination or consequences.

The supreme principle of morality is the [[concepts/categorical-imperative]]. Kant formulated it several ways:

1. **Universal Law**: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"

2. **Humanity Formula**: "Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only"

3. **Kingdom of Ends**: "Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends"

These formulations express a single principle: moral law binds all rational beings unconditionally (categorically), regardless of desires or circumstances.

## Autonomy and Freedom

For Kant, morality requires freedom. We must be free from determination by natural causes to be morally responsible. But causality governs all phenomena. How can we be both causally determined and free?

Kant's solution: as phenomena (empirical selves), we are causally determined. As noumena (rational selves), we may be free. Freedom cannot be proved theoretically but must be presupposed practically for morality to make sense.

This "practical postulate" of freedom, along with postulates of God and immortality, falls under practical rather than theoretical reason.

## Legacy

Kant transformed philosophy. After him, epistemology could never be naive realism, and ethics could never ignore the question of rational justification.

German Idealists like [[people/hegel]], Fichte, and Schelling extended and transformed his ideas. [[people/schopenhauer]] drew on his distinction between phenomena and noumena. Analytic philosophy developed partly in response to neo-Kantian movements. Contemporary moral philosophy, from Rawls to Korsgaard, remains deeply Kantian.

His questions—What can I know? What ought I to do? What may I hope?—remain central to philosophy today.
