# René Descartes (1596-1650)

René Descartes was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, widely considered the father of modern Western philosophy. His work established the foundations of 17th-century continental rationalism and laid the groundwork for modern philosophy and mathematics.

## Life

Born to minor nobility in France, Descartes received an excellent Jesuit education. Despite excelling at school, he later wrote that he found little certain knowledge there, except in mathematics.

After studying law at Poitiers, Descartes joined the army of Maurice of Nassau, seeking "the book of the world." On November 10, 1619, while stationed in Germany, he experienced a series of dreams that convinced him of his life's mission: to reform all knowledge on mathematical foundations.

He spent most of his adult life in the Dutch Republic, valuing its intellectual freedom. In 1649, Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to her court. The harsh Swedish winter and early morning philosophy lessons (at 5 AM to accommodate the queen's schedule) proved fatal. Descartes died of pneumonia in February 1650.

## Method of Doubt

In [[works/meditations]], Descartes employed radical skepticism as a method. He systematically doubted everything that could possibly be doubted, seeking a foundation of absolute certainty.

His doubts progressed through stages:
1. **Senses**: They sometimes deceive us (optical illusions, dreams)
2. **Dreams**: How can we know we're not dreaming?
3. **Evil demon**: Perhaps a powerful deceiver manipulates all our beliefs

Even mathematics seemed vulnerable—what if an evil demon makes us err even in simple addition?

## Cogito Ergo Sum

From the depths of doubt emerged Descartes' famous [[concepts/cogito]]: "I think, therefore I am" (Cogito ergo sum).

Even if an evil demon deceives me about everything, the very act of doubting proves that I exist. I might be wrong about having a body, about the external world, even about mathematics—but I cannot be wrong about my own existence as a thinking thing.

This provided Descartes with his indubitable foundation. From here, he attempted to rebuild human knowledge.

## Cartesian Dualism

Descartes argued that reality consists of two fundamentally different substances:

| Mind (res cogitans) | Body (res extensa) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Thinking | Extended in space |
| Unextended | Not thinking |
| Indivisible | Divisible |
| Free | Mechanistic |

The mind is essentially a thinking thing; the body is essentially an extended thing. They interact but are ontologically distinct.

This [[concepts/cartesian-dualism]] created the modern "mind-body problem": How can two such different substances interact? Descartes suggested they connected through the pineal gland in the brain, but this answer satisfied few.

## Mathematics

Descartes' mathematical contributions were revolutionary. He invented analytical (coordinate) geometry, which connects algebra and geometry. The Cartesian coordinate system—using x and y axes to represent points—is named after him.

This innovation allowed geometric problems to be solved algebraically and algebraic equations to be visualized geometrically. It was essential for the later development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.

## Physics and Mechanism

Descartes viewed the physical world as a vast machine governed by mathematical laws. Bodies interact through contact and motion—no mysterious forces acting at a distance. Even animals were mere automata, lacking souls.

His physics was less successful than his mathematics. He rejected the vacuum and proposed vortex theories of planetary motion. Newton's physics eventually superseded Descartes', but the mechanistic worldview persisted.

## Method

In [[works/discourse-method]], Descartes outlined four rules for proper inquiry:

1. **Evidence**: Accept only what is clearly and distinctly perceived
2. **Analysis**: Divide problems into smaller parts
3. **Synthesis**: Proceed from simple to complex
4. **Enumeration**: Review thoroughly to ensure nothing is omitted

This method aimed to extend mathematical certainty to all knowledge.

## Legacy

Descartes transformed philosophy. His radical doubt established epistemology as central to philosophical inquiry. His dualism shaped debates about mind and body that continue today. His mathematical innovations remain foundational.

The continental rationalists—[[people/spinoza]], [[people/leibniz]], and Malebranche—all worked in his shadow. Even empiricists who rejected his conclusions engaged deeply with his questions. [[people/kant]]'s critical philosophy was partly an attempt to overcome the rationalist-empiricist divide Descartes helped create.

Every philosophy student still reads the [[works/meditations]], and "Cartesian" remains a common adjective in philosophy, mathematics, and beyond.
