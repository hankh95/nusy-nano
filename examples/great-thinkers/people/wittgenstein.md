# Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)

Ludwig Wittgenstein was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. He is considered one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century.

## Life

Born into one of Europe's wealthiest families in Vienna, Wittgenstein trained as an engineer before becoming fascinated with the foundations of mathematics. He studied under [[people/russell]] at Cambridge, where he made an immediate impression.

During World War I, he served in the Austrian army and completed his first major work, [[works/tractatus]], in a prisoner-of-war camp. Believing he had solved all philosophical problems, he gave away his inheritance, trained as an elementary school teacher, worked as a gardener, and designed a house for his sister.

In 1929, he returned to Cambridge, where he revolutionized philosophy again with ideas completely different from his earlier work. He became professor of philosophy in 1939 but found academic life stifling. He died of prostate cancer in 1951, reportedly saying, "Tell them I've had a wonderful life."

## Two Philosophies

Uniquely, Wittgenstein developed two distinct and influential philosophical systems:

### Early Wittgenstein: The Tractatus

[[works/tractatus]] (1921) presents a "picture theory" of language. Language depicts reality by sharing logical form with what it describes. Meaningful propositions picture possible facts.

The work consists of numbered propositions:
- "The world is everything that is the case"
- "What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent"

Philosophy's job is to clarify thoughts and expose nonsense. Metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics are unsayable—not false, but beyond the limits of meaningful language.

### Later Wittgenstein: Investigations

[[works/philosophical-investigations]] (published 1953) repudiates much of the Tractatus. Language doesn't have one essence (picturing). It consists of countless [[concepts/language-games]]—activities in which words have meaning.

"Don't ask for the meaning, ask for the use." Words mean what they do in practice, not what they picture. The meaning of "game" isn't a common essence but a [[concepts/family-resemblance]]—overlapping similarities without one feature shared by all.

## Language Games

A **language game** is a simplified model of language use, or the whole complex of language and activities interwoven with it.

Examples of language games:
- Giving and following orders
- Reporting events
- Making up stories
- Guessing riddles
- Making jokes
- Translating

Meaning comes from participation in these activities, not from correspondence between words and objects.

## Private Language Argument

Wittgenstein argued that a truly private language—one only its speaker could understand—is impossible. If there's no public criterion for using words correctly, there's no distinction between seeming right and being right. Without that distinction, there's no rule-following, hence no language.

This challenges Cartesian privacy of mind and has implications for philosophy of mind and language.

## Method

Later Wittgenstein saw philosophy not as building theories but as therapy—dissolving philosophical puzzles by understanding how language misled us into posing them.

"Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language."

Philosophical problems arise when "language goes on holiday"—when we abstract words from their normal use and get confused.

## Legacy

Wittgenstein influenced virtually all subsequent analytic philosophy:

- **Ordinary language philosophy**: Austin, Ryle, Strawson
- **Philosophy of mind**: The problem of other minds, functionalism
- **Philosophy of religion**: D.Z. Phillips, non-cognitive approaches
- **Rule-following**: Kripke's interpretation sparked endless debate
- **Continental philosophy**: Surprising resonances with Heidegger

His writing style—aphoristic, numbered, self-questioning—is unmistakable. Whether early or late, his demand to look at how language actually works changed philosophy forever.
