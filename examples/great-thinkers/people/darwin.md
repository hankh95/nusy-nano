# Charles Darwin (1809-1882)

Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in the history of science. He established that all species of life have descended from common ancestors through a process he called [[concepts/natural-selection]].

## Life

Born into a wealthy and prominent family (his grandfather was Erasmus Darwin, and his other grandfather Josiah Wedgwood), Darwin initially studied medicine at Edinburgh before transferring to Cambridge to prepare for the clergy.

The transformative event of his life was the five-year voyage of HMS Beagle (1831-1836), during which he collected specimens and made observations—particularly in the Galápagos Islands—that would shape his theory.

After returning, Darwin spent two decades gathering evidence before publishing [[works/origin-of-species]] in 1859. He had been prompted to publish when Alfred Russel Wallace independently arrived at similar conclusions.

Darwin spent his later years at Down House, working on various subjects including earthworms, orchids, and human emotion. He suffered from chronic illness, possibly Chagas disease contracted in South America.

## The Theory of Evolution

### Natural Selection

Darwin's great insight was that evolution operates through natural selection:

1. **Variation**: Individuals within a species vary
2. **Inheritance**: Offspring resemble parents
3. **Overproduction**: More offspring are born than survive
4. **Differential survival**: Individuals with advantageous traits survive better
5. **Accumulation**: Over generations, beneficial traits become more common

No designer is needed. Given variation, heredity, and differential reproduction, evolution happens automatically.

### The Mechanism

Darwin didn't know how heredity worked (Mendel's genetics was unknown to him), but he understood its effects. Traits that help organisms survive and reproduce spread; traits that harm survival and reproduction disappear.

Given enough time, this process can produce all the diversity of life from a common ancestor.

### Evidence

Darwin marshaled evidence from multiple sources:

- **Biogeography**: Distribution of species matches descent with modification
- **Fossils**: Show transitions between forms
- **Homology**: Similar structures in different species (human arm, whale flipper, bat wing)
- **Embryology**: Different species have similar developmental stages
- **Artificial selection**: Breeders produce dramatic changes in generations

## Philosophical Implications

Darwin's theory had revolutionary implications:

### Design Without Designer
Nature's apparent design—the eye, the wing, camouflage—could be explained without invoking a creator. This challenged natural theology and the argument from design.

### Human Nature
In [[works/descent-of-man]] (1871), Darwin applied evolution to humans. We are part of the animal kingdom, descended from ape-like ancestors. Our moral sense, reason, and emotions evolved like any other trait.

### Teleology
Aristotelian "final causes" became unnecessary. Organisms don't have purposes imposed from outside; apparent purpose results from adaptation through natural selection.

### Progress?
Darwin resisted seeing evolution as progress toward higher forms. Evolution has no direction—only adaptation to local environments. Humans aren't "more evolved" than bacteria.

## Reception

[[works/origin-of-species]] sold out on its first day. Response was mixed:

- **Scientific**: Many scientists quickly accepted evolution, though natural selection was more controversial until the Modern Synthesis (1930s-40s)
- **Religious**: Varied from rejection to accommodation (some saw evolution as God's method)
- **Social**: "Social Darwinism" (which Darwin didn't endorse) misapplied evolutionary ideas to society

## Legacy

Darwin's influence extends far beyond biology:

- **Medicine**: Understanding evolution of pathogens, antibiotic resistance
- **Psychology**: Evolutionary psychology studies the evolved mind
- **Philosophy**: Naturalized epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind
- **Culture**: Changed how humanity sees itself in nature

As Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."

Darwin showed that complex, purposive-seeming systems can arise from simple, mechanistic processes—a profound insight that reverberates through science and philosophy.
