# Socrates (470-399 BCE)

Socrates is considered one of the founders of Western philosophy. Unlike earlier philosophers who focused on cosmology and natural science, Socrates turned philosophical inquiry toward ethics and human nature: How should one live? What is virtue? What is justice?

## Life

Socrates was born in Athens to a stonemason father and a midwife mother. He served as a hoplite in the Peloponnesian War, showing remarkable courage at the battles of Potidaea, Delium, and Amphipolis. He spent most of his life in the Athenian agora, engaging citizens in philosophical dialogue.

He married Xanthippe, with whom he had three sons. Despite his reputation, he lived in poverty, claiming that the pursuit of wisdom left no time for money-making.

## The Socratic Method

Socrates developed a distinctive method of inquiry through question-and-answer dialogue. Rather than lecturing, he would profess ignorance and ask probing questions that revealed contradictions in his interlocutors' beliefs. This "elenchus" or cross-examination aimed not to win arguments but to approach truth through the elimination of false beliefs.

His typical approach:
1. Ask for a definition (e.g., "What is justice?")
2. Examine the proposed definition through questions
3. Find contradictions or counterexamples
4. Refine or abandon the definition
5. Repeat until reaching aporia (puzzlement) or insight

## "I Know That I Know Nothing"

Socrates famously claimed that his wisdom consisted only in knowing that he knew nothing. When the Oracle at Delphi declared him the wisest man in Athens, Socrates set out to disprove this by finding someone wiser. After questioning politicians, poets, and craftsmen, he concluded that he alone recognized his own ignorance—making him wiser than those who falsely believed they had knowledge.

## Trial and Death

In 399 BCE, Socrates was charged with impiety (not believing in the city's gods) and corrupting the youth. The real motivations were likely political—several of his associates had been involved in anti-democratic movements.

At his trial, Socrates refused to beg for mercy or propose a meaningful alternative punishment. He was sentenced to death and drank hemlock poison, surrounded by friends who recorded his final conversations.

## Legacy

Socrates wrote nothing himself. We know his philosophy through the dialogues of [[people/plato]], the memoirs of Xenophon, and comic portrayals by Aristophanes. His influence on Western philosophy is immeasurable—virtually every subsequent school of Greek philosophy claimed him as an inspiration.

The [[concepts/socratic-method]] remains central to legal education, psychotherapy, and critical thinking pedagogy. His commitment to following argument wherever it leads, even to death, established philosophy as a way of life rather than merely an academic discipline.

## Key Ideas

- **Virtue is knowledge**: Wrongdoing stems from ignorance; no one does evil willingly
- **Care of the soul**: The soul's health matters more than wealth or reputation
- **The examined life**: "The unexamined life is not worth living"
- **Intellectual humility**: Wisdom begins with recognizing one's own ignorance
