# Aristotle (384-322 BCE)

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology, and government. He is considered one of the most influential thinkers in Western history.

## Life

Born in Stagira, northern Greece, Aristotle's father was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. At seventeen, Aristotle joined [[people/plato]]'s Academy in Athens, where he remained for twenty years until Plato's death.

After leaving the Academy, Aristotle tutored the young Alexander (later [[people/alexander-great]]) for several years. In 335 BCE, he returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lyceum. Because Aristotle lectured while walking in the covered walkways (peripatoi), his followers were called Peripatetics.

## Critique of Plato

While deeply influenced by [[people/plato]], Aristotle rejected key aspects of his teacher's philosophy. His famous statement "Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth" captures his independence.

Against Plato's [[concepts/theory-of-forms]], Aristotle argued:
- Forms cannot exist separately from particulars
- The "participation" relation is unexplained
- Forms would need forms ad infinitum (Third Man Argument)

Instead, Aristotle held that form and matter are inseparable. A bronze statue's form (shape) cannot exist apart from its matter (bronze).

## Logic

Aristotle essentially invented formal logic, which he called "analytics." His system of syllogistic reasoning dominated logic for over two thousand years until the work of Frege and Russell.

A syllogism consists of:
- Major premise: All men are mortal
- Minor premise: Socrates is a man
- Conclusion: Socrates is mortal

He identified valid argument forms and fallacies, establishing logic as a tool for all sciences.

## The Four Causes

Aristotle's [[concepts/four-causes]] explains why things exist:

| Cause | Question | Example (Statue) |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Material | What is it made of? | Bronze |
| Formal | What is its form? | Human shape |
| Efficient | What made it? | The sculptor |
| Final | What is its purpose? | Honor or beauty |

The final cause (telos) was central to Aristotle's worldview. Everything has a natural end or purpose toward which it strives.

## Ethics

In [[works/nicomachean-ethics]], Aristotle developed [[concepts/virtue-ethics]]. The highest human good is eudaimonia (flourishing or happiness), achieved through virtuous activity.

Key concepts:
- **Virtue as habit**: We become virtuous by practicing virtue
- **The mean**: Each virtue lies between two vices (courage between cowardice and recklessness)
- **Practical wisdom (phronesis)**: Knowing how to act virtuously in specific situations
- **Contemplation**: The highest activity, making humans most godlike

## Biology

Aristotle was a pioneering biologist who classified over 500 species of animals. He conducted careful observations, dissections, and even embryological studies. Though some conclusions were wrong, his methods anticipated modern scientific inquiry.

He recognized that dolphins are mammals, described the reproductive systems of various animals, and understood that some sharks give live birth. Many observations weren't confirmed until the 19th century.

## Physics and Cosmology

Aristotle's physics, while later superseded, was remarkably systematic. He distinguished:
- **Natural motion**: Heavy things fall toward the center; light things rise
- **Violent motion**: Motion contrary to nature, requiring a mover
- **Celestial motion**: Circular, eternal motion of heavenly bodies

His geocentric cosmology, combined with Ptolemy's mathematical models, dominated astronomy until Copernicus.

## Politics

In [[works/politics]], Aristotle analyzed various constitutions and argued that humans are "political animals" who naturally live in communities. He classified governments by who rules and whether they serve the common good:

| Rulers | Good | Corrupt |
|--------|------|---------|
| One | Kingship | Tyranny |
| Few | Aristocracy | Oligarchy |
| Many | Polity | Democracy |

## Legacy

Aristotle's influence cannot be overstated. His logic was the logic until the 19th century. His biology founded the discipline. His ethics remains a living tradition. Medieval Christian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy all grappled with his thought.

Thomas [[people/aquinas]] synthesized Aristotle with Christianity. Averroes and Maimonides integrated his work into Islamic and Jewish philosophy. Even his errors were productive, giving later scientists something precise to argue against.
