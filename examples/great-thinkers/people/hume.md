# David Hume (1711-1776)

David Hume was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism. He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of Western philosophy.

## Life

Born in Edinburgh, Hume came from a minor Scottish noble family. He briefly studied law but found it disagreeable. At eighteen, he devoted himself entirely to philosophy.

In 1734, he moved to France to write his first major work, [[works/treatise-human-nature]], published when he was just twenty-eight. It "fell dead-born from the press," as he later wrote, receiving little attention.

Hume later found success with his essays, political writings, and his monumental History of England. He served as a librarian, diplomat, and under-secretary of state. His pleasant disposition earned him the nickname "le bon David" in Parisian salons.

Despite his fame, Hume's religious skepticism prevented him from obtaining a university professorship. He died in 1776, composing his own epitaph: "Born 1711, Died [blank]. Leaving it to posterity to add the rest."

## Empiricism

Hume pushed [[concepts/empiricism]] to its logical conclusions. All ideas, he argued, derive from impressions (sensory experiences). Any idea that cannot be traced to an impression is meaningless.

He distinguished:
- **Impressions**: Lively perceptions from direct experience
- **Ideas**: Faint copies of impressions used in thinking

Complex ideas are combinations of simple ideas, all ultimately traceable to impressions. Abstract concepts like "virtue" or "causation" must be analyzable in terms of concrete experiences.

## The Problem of Induction

Hume's most famous contribution is the [[concepts/problem-of-induction]]. We believe the future will resemble the past—that the sun will rise tomorrow because it always has. But what justifies this belief?

Not logic: It's not contradictory for the future to differ from the past.

Not experience: Using past experience to justify induction is circular (it assumes what it's trying to prove).

Hume concluded that induction cannot be rationally justified. We believe in causal connections due to habit and custom, not reason. This "problem of induction" remains unsolved and deeply influential.

## Causation

Hume analyzed our idea of [[concepts/causation]]. When we say one event causes another, what do we mean? We observe:

1. **Contiguity**: Cause and effect are close in space
2. **Priority**: The cause precedes the effect
3. **Constant conjunction**: Similar causes always produce similar effects

But we never observe a "necessary connection" between cause and effect. We merely observe regular succession. The feeling of necessity comes from our minds, not from the world.

This analysis had revolutionary implications: if causation is merely constant conjunction, then the necessity we attribute to natural laws is psychological, not metaphysical.

## The Self

Hume applied his empiricism to personal identity, developing the [[concepts/bundle-theory]]. When he introspected, he found only particular perceptions—a sight, a sound, a feeling—never a unified "self."

"When I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other... I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception."

The self, Hume concluded, is just a bundle or collection of perceptions, not a unified substance. Personal identity is a fiction produced by imagination.

## Ethics

Hume argued that morality is based on sentiment, not reason. Reason alone cannot motivate action; only passion can. When we call something morally good, we're expressing a feeling of approval, not describing a fact.

The [[concepts/is-ought-problem]] (Hume's guillotine) points out that one cannot derive "ought" from "is"—moral conclusions don't follow from factual premises alone. This insight remains central to metaethics.

## Philosophy of Religion

Hume was deeply skeptical of religious claims, though he rarely stated his views directly due to social constraints. His Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, published posthumously, devastatingly criticizes arguments for God's existence, particularly the design argument.

He argued that miracles cannot be believed on testimony—the probability that witnesses are mistaken or lying always exceeds the probability that nature's laws were violated.

## Legacy

Hume's influence is immense. [[people/kant]] famously said that Hume "awoke me from my dogmatic slumber," prompting his critical philosophy. His analysis of causation influenced science and philosophy of science. His ethical theory anticipated emotivism and expressivism.

His gentle skepticism, naturalism about human nature, and insistence on tracing ideas to experience shaped the empiricist tradition that runs through Mill, Russell, and the logical positivists to contemporary philosophy.
