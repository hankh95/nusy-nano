# Categorical Imperative

The **Categorical Imperative** is [[people/kant]]'s supreme principle of morality, introduced in his [[works/groundwork-metaphysics-morals]] (1785). It provides a test for determining whether an action is morally permissible, based purely on reason without reference to consequences or desires.

## Categorical vs. Hypothetical Imperatives

Kant distinguished two types of commands:

| Hypothetical | Categorical |
|--------------|-------------|
| "If you want X, do Y" | "Do Y" (period) |
| Conditional | Unconditional |
| Depends on desires | Applies regardless of desires |
| "If you want to be healthy, exercise" | "Do not lie" |

Hypothetical imperatives tell us what to do given certain goals. But morality cannot depend on contingent desires—it must bind all rational beings unconditionally. Hence moral commands are categorical.

## Formulations

Kant gave several formulations of the categorical imperative, claiming they were equivalent expressions of the same principle:

### 1. Universal Law Formula

> "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

Before acting, ask: Could everyone act this way? If universalizing your action leads to contradiction, it's wrong.

**Example - False promising:**
- Maxim: "I will make false promises when convenient"
- Universalized: Everyone makes false promises when convenient
- Result: Promises become meaningless; no one believes them
- Contradiction: You can't even will the maxim, because false promising requires others to trust promises

### 2. Humanity Formula

> "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means."

Never use people as mere tools. Respect their rational agency. Coercion, deception, and exploitation violate this principle because they bypass people's capacity for rational choice.

**Example - Deception:**
Lying to someone treats them as a means because you manipulate their beliefs to serve your purposes, denying them the information needed for autonomous choice.

### 3. Kingdom of Ends Formula

> "Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends."

Imagine a community of rational beings who are both legislators and subjects of universal moral law. Act as a member of this ideal community would act.

This combines the universality of the first formula with the respect for persons of the second.

## Applying the Categorical Imperative

### Step 1: Identify Your Maxim
What rule would you be following? Be specific about your intention.

### Step 2: Universalize
Imagine everyone in similar situations following this rule.

### Step 3: Check for Contradiction
- **Contradiction in conception**: The universal practice would be logically impossible
- **Contradiction in will**: You couldn't rationally want everyone to act this way

### Example Applications

| Action | Maxim | Universalization | Result |
|--------|-------|------------------|--------|
| Suicide | Kill yourself when suffering | No one would survive difficulty | Can't will this |
| Breaking promises | Break promises when convenient | Promises become meaningless | Contradicts itself |
| Helping others | Never help anyone in need | You'd lack help when needed | Can't rationally will |
| Developing talents | Let all talents rust | Reason demands some cultivation | Can't rationally will |

## Perfect vs. Imperfect Duties

Kant distinguished:

| Perfect Duties | Imperfect Duties |
|----------------|------------------|
| Never violate | Sometimes fulfill |
| Admit no exceptions | Allow latitude in how/when |
| "Do not lie" | "Help others" |
| Negative | Positive |

Perfect duties (no lying, no murder) are absolute. Imperfect duties (charity, self-improvement) require us to adopt certain ends but leave room for judgment about when and how to pursue them.

## Criticisms

### Rigorism
Kant seemed to allow no exceptions. Must you never lie, even to murderers asking where your friend is hiding? Kant notoriously said yes. Many find this too rigid.

### Empty Formalism
Does the categorical imperative actually tell us anything? Critics argue you can universalize almost any maxim if described cleverly. "Lie when necessary to save innocent lives" seems universalizable.

### Conflicts of Duty
What if duties conflict? "Do not lie" vs. "Protect the innocent." Kant provided no clear resolution mechanism.

### Ignoring Consequences
Isn't it relevant that lying to the murderer might save a life? Kant's focus on intentions to the exclusion of outcomes strikes many as one-sided.

## Legacy

Despite criticisms, the categorical imperative remains tremendously influential:

- **John Rawls**: His "original position" echoes universalizability
- **Discourse ethics**: Habermas developed a dialogical version
- **Human rights**: The dignity-based foundation for universal rights
- **Medical ethics**: Informed consent reflects respect for autonomy
- **Business ethics**: Stakeholder theory draws on treating people as ends

The core insights—that morality should be impartial, that persons deserve respect, that we shouldn't make exceptions for ourselves—remain compelling even when the specific formulations are debated.
