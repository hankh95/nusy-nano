# Socratic Method

The **Socratic Method** (also called Socratic questioning or elenchus) is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue developed by [[people/socrates]]. Rather than lecturing, the questioner stimulates critical thinking through carefully crafted questions that expose contradictions in the interlocutor's beliefs.

## How It Works

### The Basic Pattern

1. **Claim**: The interlocutor makes a claim (e.g., "Justice is giving everyone what they deserve")

2. **Questions**: Socrates asks clarifying questions, exploring the claim's implications

3. **Contradiction**: The questioning reveals that the claim conflicts with other beliefs the interlocutor holds

4. **Aporia**: Both parties reach puzzlement (aporia), recognizing their ignorance

5. **Refinement**: A revised claim emerges, and the process repeats

### An Example

From [[people/plato]]'s dialogue Euthyphro:

**Socrates**: What is piety?

**Euthyphro**: Piety is what is loved by the gods.

**Socrates**: But the gods disagree—different gods love different things. So the same thing would be both pious and impious.

**Euthyphro**: Let me revise: Piety is what all the gods love.

**Socrates**: Is something pious because the gods love it, or do the gods love it because it is pious?

**Euthyphro**: [Unable to answer satisfactorily]

This "Euthyphro dilemma" remains central to philosophy of religion today.

## Key Features

### Feigned Ignorance (Socratic Irony)

Socrates claimed to know nothing and approached conversations as a learner. This wasn't entirely genuine—he knew how to expose contradictions—but it created a non-threatening atmosphere and encouraged genuine inquiry.

### Midwifery (Maieutics)

Socrates compared himself to a midwife. Just as a midwife helps deliver babies but doesn't give birth herself, Socrates helped others give birth to ideas but claimed to have none of his own to impart.

### Focus on Definitions

Socratic dialogues often seek definitions. "What is courage?" "What is virtue?" "What is knowledge?" The question "What is X?" proves surprisingly difficult for concepts we use daily.

### Testing Not Teaching

The method tests beliefs rather than transmitting information. It assumes the interlocutor already has latent knowledge that questioning can draw out—a precursor to Plato's doctrine of recollection.

## Types of Socratic Questions

| Question Type | Purpose | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Clarification | Define terms | "What do you mean by 'freedom'?" |
| Probing assumptions | Expose hidden premises | "What are you assuming here?" |
| Evidence | Examine support | "How do you know that?" |
| Viewpoints | Consider alternatives | "What might someone disagree?" |
| Implications | Trace consequences | "If that's true, then what follows?" |
| Meta-question | Reflect on the inquiry | "Why is this question important?" |

## Applications

### Legal Education

American law schools famously use the Socratic method. Professors cold-call students and question them about cases, forcing them to articulate legal reasoning under pressure. Critics find it intimidating; defenders say it develops essential skills for courtroom argumentation.

### Psychotherapy

Cognitive behavioral therapy uses Socratic questioning to help patients examine distorted beliefs. Rather than telling patients their thoughts are irrational, therapists guide them to discover inconsistencies themselves.

### Critical Thinking Education

Many approaches to teaching critical thinking draw on Socratic questioning. Richard Paul's taxonomy of Socratic questions is widely used in education.

### Business and Leadership

Management consultants and leadership coaches use Socratic questioning to help clients clarify goals, examine assumptions, and develop solutions.

## Limitations

### Requires Cooperation
The method only works when the interlocutor engages genuinely. It fails against someone who refuses to answer or doesn't care about consistency.

### Can Be Irritating
Socrates' constant questioning annoyed many Athenians. It can come across as manipulative or superior, especially when the questioner clearly has an agenda.

### Negative Results
The method often ends in aporia—confusion—without positive conclusions. It's better at destroying false beliefs than establishing true ones.

### Power Dynamics
In classrooms, Socratic questioning can feel like intellectual bullying when students lack the professor's expertise. The power imbalance undermines genuine dialogue.

## Legacy

The Socratic method established a style of philosophy—argumentative, questioning, definitional—that defined Western thought. It appears throughout [[people/plato]]'s dialogues and influenced:

- **Aristotle's dialectic**: Philosophical argumentation starting from common opinions
- **Medieval disputation**: Formal academic debate in universities
- **Modern philosophy**: The emphasis on clear definitions and logical consistency
- **Scientific method**: Hypothesis testing through attempts at falsification

Whether in courtrooms, therapy offices, or philosophy classrooms, asking "What do you mean?" and "How do you know?" remains the Socratic legacy.
